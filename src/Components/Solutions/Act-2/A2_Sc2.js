<strong>i) Who is Launcelot Gobbo? What inner struggle is going on in his conscience? What does his struggle show about the contemporary Christian practice?
</strong><br />
Ans: Launcelot Gobbo is Shylock’s servant. An inner struggle is going on in his mind between his conscience advising him to be a faithful servant and the devil tempting him to leave Shylock’s service and take up service with Bassanio.

Besides, he fears that he would become a Jew if he served Shylock any longer. Initially, his conscience tells him not to run away from Shylock’s household and to be careful. However, when the devil persuades him to flee, his conscience tells him that as he is the child of a good father or at least a good mother and so, he should stay where he is and not move.

<strong>iii) Launcelot’s speech provides some comic relief in the play? Why was such a relief need in the context of the play?

<br />  <br />

<strong>v) Finally, whom does Launcelot obey-the devil or his conscience? How is the theme of racial discrimination brought out in Launcelot’s decision to run away?

Ans: Finally, Launcelot obeys the devil. The theme of racial discrimination is brought out in Launcelot’s decision to run away because he runs away from his master, Shylock, who was a Jew and takes up service with Bassanio, a Christian.
<br />  <br />


<strong>vi) How is the theme of conflict between the good and the evil shown in this scene?

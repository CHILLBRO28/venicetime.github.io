<strong>i) Give reasons for Launcelot’s leaving Jessica’s house.
</strong><br />
   Ans:  Launcelot was leaving Jessica’s house as his master was
   not only a miser but also of a tyrannical nature. Launcelot
   felt he was half-starved by his master who was a devil in human
   shape.
   <br /><br />
   <strong>ii) Give the meaning of:
 Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
 Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
 </strong><br />
   Ans:  Jessica means that her house was as miserable as hell and
   that it was enlivened by the merry presence of Launcelot who
   cheered her with his presence.
   <br /><br />
   <strong>iii) How does Jessica show in words and action that she liked
Launcelot’s presence in her house?</strong>
<br />
   Ans. Jessica sympathizes with Launcelot and expresses her
   gratefulness to him for temporarily robbing her wretched house
   of its boredom. She also gives a dollar to him as an
   appreciation for his cheerful presence. She also shows her
   faith in him by giving him a letter to be secretly delivered to
   Lorenzo.
   <br /><br />
   <strong>iv) What errand does Jessica give to Launcelot? What precautions
does she ask him to take while doing the errand?
</strong><br />
   Ans:  Jessica gives to Launcelot the errand of delivering a
   letter to Lorenzo at supper in Bassanio’s House that night. She
   advises him to deliver the letter to Lorenzo secretly.
   <br /><br />
   <strong>v) How does Jessica show herself as a scheming but prudent young
lady? In what way is her character different from that of Portia?
</strong><br />
   Ans:  Jessica shows herself as a scheming lady when she plans
   to elope with a Christian boy, Lorenzo without the knowledge of
   her father. She proves herself to be prudent when she instructs
   Launcelot to deliver the letter to Lorenzo at Bassanio’s party
   secretly. Her character is entirely different from that of
   Portia. While Portia obeys her deceased father’s will to marry
   the one who wins the lottery of caskets, Jessica betrays her
   father and religion to marry a Christian many Lorenzo.
   <br /><br /><br />

 <strong>i) How does Launcelot bid farewell to Jessica? In this context, what
are your feelings for Launcelot, Jessica, and Shylock?
</strong><br /> 
   Ans:  Launcelot bids farewell to Jessica calling her ‘most
   beautiful pagan’ and later ‘most sweet Jew’. Launcelot gets
   very emotional when he bids farewell to Jessica. He feels sad
   and with tears in his eyes he bids her goodbye. We feel
   relieved as Launcelot was ultimately leaving his callous master
   and would be happier serving Bassanio. For Jessica who detests
   her father for his oppression, we feel sad as Launcelot was one
   person who cheered her up in this miserable hell. We feel sorry
   for Shylock who has alienated himself from his near and dear
   ones becau<br />se of his rigidity and passion for money.
   <br />
   <strong>ii) Why does Jessica regret being the daughter of Shylock? What is
the ‘henious sin’ referred to in the extract? Is it really a ‘sin’?
Give reasons to justify your answer.
</strong><br />
   Ans:  Jessica regrets being the daughter of Shylock because of
   his insensitive, hostile and miserly attitude. Jessica feels
   guilty that she was ashamed of being her father’s daughter and
   that she was ready to reject her cultural background and
   religion and marry a Christian. It was not a ‘sin’ because her
   father was a miserly tyrant who failed to give love and
   affection to his daughter.
   <br /><br />
   <strong>iii) Give the meaning of:
   But though I am a daughter to his blood,
   I am not to his manners.
  </strong> <br />
   Ans:  Jessica is ashamed to admit that she was the daughter of
   an oppressive, callous father, Shylock but she feels that she
   didn’t have the negative qualities of her father.
   <br /><br />
   <strong>iv) Explain Jessica’s relationship with her father which is shown in
the scene.
</strong><br />
   Ans:  Jessica is alienated from her father and detests him for
   making her house a ‘hell’ with his fanatic, insensitive and
   oppressive attitude. She is rebellious and wants to be free
   from her father’s autocratic rule. Though she is torn by a
   conflict between her obligation to her father and her loyalty
   to her lover, yet she prefers to revolt and marries Lorenzo,
   who is a Christian.
   <br /><br />
   <strong>v) Which promise has Lorenzo to keep? Describe the strife that
Jessica is going to end.
</strong><br />
   Ans:  Lorenzo had promised to help her in eloping with him. If
   he was successful in doing so, she would no longer face the
   conflict of being divided between loyalty to her father and
   love for Lorenzo as she would marry him to become a Christian.

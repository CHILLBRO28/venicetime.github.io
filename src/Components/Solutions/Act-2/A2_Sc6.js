 <strong>iv) What is meant by ‘to play the thieves for wives’? How apt are these remarks in the context?
</strong><br />
Ans:  'To play the thieves for wives' means if any of them wishes to do what he is doing that night and steal away a fair lady to be his wife he will wait as long as they have done to help him on the occasion.

<strong>i) What do you think is sent down in the casket? How can you conclude that the contents in the casket are valuable?
</strong><br />
Ans: The casket must have valuables like jewellery which Jessica has stolen from her house. We can conclude that the contents in the casket are valuables since Jessica hands over the casket only after making sure that the person to whom she is giving the casket is her love, Lorenzo. Besides, she tells Lorenzo that it is worth carrying the casket.
<br /><br />

<strong>ii) What is meant by ‘I am much ashamed of my exchange'? Why is the exchange needed?
</strong><br />
Ans: The above words mean that Jessica is much ashamed that she has to change her dress to that of a page boy. This exchange was needed for her to elope with Lorenzo.
<br /><br />
<strong>iii) In what way is love blind in the context? Who is referred to as Cupid? Why would he blush?
</strong><br />
Ans: Love is blind in the context since it makes Jessica dress like a page boy, steal jewellery and money from her house and be ready to elope with Lorenzo, a Christian. Cupid is the classical God of love who is always represented as a blind boy with bows and arrows. Jessica says that Cupid, the little blind God of love himself would be shocked and blush if he saw her dressed like a boy.
<br /><br />
<strong>iv) How is Jessica’s feminine nature is highlighted in the extract?
</strong><br />
Ans: Jessica’s feminine nature is highlighted in the extract. Her shyness at her male clothes shows her feminine modesty as in Elizabethan times women never wore men’s clothes. Also she comes down from her house after making sure that the person who has come to take her is Lorenzo, her lover.
<br /><br />
<strong>v) What is meant by a torch bearer? In what way Jessica would hold a candle to her shames, if she were a torch bearer?
</strong><br />
Ans: Masquerades were dramatic performances where players wore masks and costumes and took part in a torch like procession playing drums and fife. Jessica was to carry the torch light or candle. If she carries the candle, she will show up her shameful acts- her male attire, the casket containing her theft and the fact of her elopement.
